# install

`$ git clone https://github.com/ryu0121/cli_app.git`

# URL

https://ryu0121.github.io/cli_app/

# Objective

The primary reason why I created this app is to learn the basic functions of CLI and to try to create it on my own.Throughout this project, I teach myself how to use Tree data structure and Linked List. Furthermore, I was really concious of OOP and Design Pattern to make it easy to expand this app and modify it.

# Plan

This app doesn't have options and some commands yet.
Comming soon.
